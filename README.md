# Star Wars Weather

This website allows you to see the temperature in different places, and see
what planet it feels like! (this is the code of the website)

the idea was made by Tom Scott, you can find him [here](https://www.youtube.com/TomScottGo),

code was based off of a tutorial made by Jonah Lawrence, you can find him [here](https://www.youtube.com/c/DevProTips/featured).
